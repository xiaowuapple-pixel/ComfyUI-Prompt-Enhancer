"""Qwen-Image-2.1 prompt enhancer node.

Thin ComfyUI wrapper around the official prompt-rewrite contract:
https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image-2.1/tree/main/prompt_rewrite

The two prompt-enhancer checkpoints (Qwen-Image-2.1-PE-T2I / -PE-I2I) are
fine-tuned Qwen3.5-VL 9B models. They turn a short request into the long prompt
the 2.1 model expects, and they answer with a small JSON object that also
carries the canvas decision (wh_ratio / ratio_follow).

Task profiles, the thinking split and the answer parser mirror
`prompt_rewrite/pe_core.py`. The task-specific system prompts are the ones that
ship inside the checkpoints, kept next to this file so they cannot drift away
from the weights they belong to.
